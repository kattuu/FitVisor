As a result, the hearts of smokers have to work harder to ensure adequate circulation during the workouts. The increased heart rate also raises your blood pressure. As the blood flow diminishes due to narrowed blood vessels, the working muscles do not get enough oxygen-rich blood when they need the most during gruelling workouts, which means you will get into anaerobic state (a state where your body starts producing lactic acid, the reason behind the burning sensation felt in the muscles) very easily and that means very low endurance.\n" +

Insulin is a protein cum hormone which is released after you eat carb-rich foods and serves as a signal for the muscle cells to absorb glucose idling in the blood stream. The glucose is released after you eat meals, and it is used to produce ATP energy cells for the body. Now, when you become resistant to insulin, your muscle cells refuse to respond to the cue to absorb glucose from the blood and you become energy deprived despite an overload of glucose in the blood.\n";
